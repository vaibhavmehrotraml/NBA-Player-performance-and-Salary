## Exploration of NBA Player Performance &amp; Salary

A three month project culminating in a 10-minute poster presentation/Q & A session. Through the project, I scraped and wrangled data from multiple sources & generated concise, unbiased visuals in Python to effectively 
showcase player performance and highlight the cost-effectiveness of team salary spending over time.
